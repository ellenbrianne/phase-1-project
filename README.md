# Creatures of Habit 

This is a tool to help make evaluating your habits less daunting & changing them more manageable and effective.

## Installation

This app utilizes a local json server, rather than a public API. Follow [these](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) instructions to install a local server on your computer. 

If you already have this setup, simply run

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

in your terminal when inside app's directory.
